## Making your arduino code via OOP is a step up to regular line by line, function-based coding. 

## The main advantage of using OOP in arduino is when you have lots of sensor and motors and displays, which have common modes in declaration, instantiation, and just a few parameters change like pin number and what not. This has a deeper advantage which is OOP makes your code flexible when adding more of something without repeatitive code. 

## In this lesson we will particularly use tinkerCAD so everyone can test the final code. And also we can appreciate virtual sensors and actuators that move on screen.
