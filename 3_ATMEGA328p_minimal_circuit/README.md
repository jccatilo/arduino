Hardware needed (as worked for me):
1. Arduino Uno/Nano
2. ATMega328p DIP28 Chip on a breadboard (I just preferred putting soldering things that's why you will see a soldered assembly for demo.)
3. 1k resistor (just for testing uploaded code)
4. 1 LED (just for testing the uploaded code on the chip)
5. Male dupont cables or any wire of your preference. Use what you have man.

Files needed
1. ArduinoISP_jc.ino (I have modified this from ArduinoISP.ino to suit our arduino uno programmer and connection diagram)
2. [THIS](https://www.arduino.cc/en/uploads/Tutorial/breadboard-1-6-x.zip?_gl=1*104ebcy*_ga*MzQ5MjQ5MTU1LjE2NDc5OTk1MDc.*_ga_NEXN8H46L5*MTY1NzEyMDQ1NS4yNy4wLjE2NTcxMjA0NTUuNjA.) zip file from arduino website.
